## Setup

1. Requirements

    - A Private Internet Access **username** and **password** - [Sign up referral link](http://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-a-vpn/1218buyavpn?invite=U2FsdGVkX1-Ki-3bKiIknvTQB1F-2Tz79e8QkNeh5Zc%2CbPOXkZjc102Clh5ih5-Pa_TYyTU)
    - External firewall requirements, if you have one
        - Allow outbound TCP 853 to 1.1.1.1 to allow Unbound to resolve the PIA domain name at start. You can then block it once the container is started.
        - For VPN connection allow outbound UDP 1198
        - For the built-in web HTTP proxy, allow inbound TCP 8888
    - Docker API 1.25 to support `init`

    </p></details>

1. Launch the container with:  

    Basic Launch
    ```bash
    docker run -d --init --name=pia --restart unless-stopped --cap-add=NET_ADMIN
    -v /My/Downloads/Folder/:/downloads \
    -p 8888:8888 -e REGION="Netherlands" -e USER=xxxxxxx -e PASSWORD=xxxxxxxx \
    j4ym0/pia-qbittorrent
    ```  
    Advanced Launch
    ```bash
    docker run -d --init --name=pia --restart unless-stopped --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
    -v /My/Downloads/Folder/:/downloads -v /qBittorrent/config/:/config \
    -p 8888:8888 -e REGION="Netherlands" -e USER=xxxxxxx -e PASSWORD=xxxxxxxx \
    -e UID=3 -e GID=3 -e TZ=Etc/UTC -e PORT_FORWARDING=true \
    j4ym0/pia-qbittorrent
    ```

    Note that you can:
    - Change the many [environment variables](#environment-variables) available
    - Use `-p 8888:8888/tcp` to access the HTTP web proxy
    - Pass additional arguments to *openvpn* using Docker's command function (commands after the image name)

## Testing

Check the PIA IP address matches your expectations

try [WhatisMyIP.net torrent-ip-checker]([http://checkmyip.torrentprivacy.com/](https://www.whatismyip.net/tools/torrent-ip-checker))

Port forwarding port will be added to qBittorrent settings on startup. A port can last for up to 2 months.  
To get the user id, run `id -u USER`  
To get the group id for a user, run `id -g USER`  
PIA DNS Servers 209.222.18.222 and 209.222.18.218  
Handshake DNS Servers 103.196.38.38 and 103.196.38.39  

## Port Forwarding

If you enable port forwarding by adding `-e PORT_FORWARDING=true` your pia-qbittorrent, your container will be opened to the outside. This is beneficial when seeding/uploading. On startup a port will be requested from Private Internet Access, this port will then be opened on the containers firewall and added to the qBittorrent config. qBittorrent will then bind to that port on launch.

You can not specify a port, Private Internet Access assign a random port to your connection that will change every time. The port will be assigned for a maximum of 2 months. The container will have to keep in contact with PIA to keep the port alive and the port may be revoke if the container is not able to keep in contact. 

If the internet connection is lossed for a short time, the port remains open.  
If the internet connection is lost for longer than 15 minutes the port should remain open until the port is reassigned. Although the container is designed to restart if there is an issue with port forwarding (exit code 5), i have yet to experience a port becoming unavailable. If you seem to have an issue, restart the container or goto File and use the exit qBittorrent from the webUI. The container will restart if `--restart unless-stopped` is set .

## Connect to webUI

You can connect via your web browser using http://127.0.0.1:8888 or you public ip / LAN if you have forwarding set up

Default username: admin  
Default Password: adminadmin

The default password can be found in the output log from the container. View it with `docker logs pia-qbittorrent`

## Hooks

If you need to extend what is happening with the container, you can create a shell script hook in `/config` (looking from perspective of container so whichever place you mapped to it) called `post-vpn-connect.sh` and execute code that will run just after OpenVPN connects but before qBitTorrent starts. Good place to update tracker security with your new IP etc.

## For the paranoids

- You can review the code which essential consists in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/j4ym0/pia-qbittorrent-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile) and [entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/j4ym0/pia-qbittorrent-docker/blob/master/entrypoint.sh)
- Any issues please raise them!!
- Build the images straight from git:

    ```bash
    docker build -t j4ym0/pia-qbittorrent https://github.com/j4ym0/pia-qbittorrent-docker.git
    ```

- clone the repository and build:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/j4ym0/pia-qbittorrent-docker.git
    cd pia-qbittorrent-docker
    docker build -t j4ym0/pia-qbittorrent .
    ```

- Using docker compose:

  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/j4ym0/pia-qbittorrent-docker.git
    cd pia-qbittorrent-docker
    docker-compose up -d
  ```

- The download and unziping of PIA openvpn files is done at build for the ones not able to download the zip files
- Checksums for PIA openvpn zip files are not used as these files change often (but HTTPS is used)
- PIA Nextgen servers are used
- DNS Leaks tests seems to be ok, NEED FEEDBACK

## TODOs

- More DNS leak testing
- Edit config from environment vars
